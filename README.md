## SoftUni Issue Tracking System

This project is an application that was developed for the JavaScript Framework course 
at the Software University (softuni.com).

The application is built with AngularJs and is developed from the angular seed.
The objective of the application is create a system that holds projects, which have issues. 
Each project has a leader (the person responsible for the project) , name, description, 
a generated project key, a set of priorities which the projectâ€™s issues can use and some labels.
Each Issue has a title, description, issue key (which is automatically generated by the system), 
an assignee (the person responsible to resolve the issue), a status which must follow 
a specific status transition, a due date, a priority (which is some of the available priorities for the project), 
some labels and user-made comments.
